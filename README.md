I am a dedicated Front End Engineer with experience in developing and improving web applications. In my current role at The Dev Corporate, I have also collaborated with my team using version control and implemented unit tests for UI and functions.
 
During my Front End Development Internship, I learned core concepts of JavaScript and React Js and developed an application called Time-Tracking to measure employee productivity, reducing time spent on tracking by 20%. I collaborated with my team using version control and was selected to work on a real-world project based on performance.
 
I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from COMSATS University Islamabad, Lahore Campus, My technical skills include JavaScript, React, Next Js, Nest Js, Git, Python, HTML, and SQL, among others. Additionally, I possess strong interpersonal, collaboration, analytical, problem-solving, and time management skills.
